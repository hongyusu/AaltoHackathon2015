We have developed a personalized track recommendation engine.
The developed system can analyze all available track information, compute and recommendation a ideal track for the end user which can either match the user profile or satisfy the constraints given by the end user.
We realized the technical difficulties during the development of the system for which it is not feasible to maintain all individual track information.
To solve the problem, we construct a global track graph by mapping and analyzing individual track information which serves as the unified input to out learning and searching algorithms.
Additional, we mathematically formulate the recommendation problem as a graph searching problem and propose several running algorithms to solve the problem.
We also visualize the result both on a map and as a short movie comprised with pictures extracted from the track.
Finally, we combine the information from social network which not only adds enriched contextual information on the computed tracks but also shows the potential of building a sophisticated system in the future which is based on e.g., context searching/matching/learning.
