\section{Data preprocessing}

\edmd\ dataset contains the information of a collection of $68,479$ sport tracks (e.g., walking, running, cycling).
We use $\Tcal=\{T_i\}_{i=1}^n$ to denote the collection of tracks where $n=68,479$.
Each track $T_i\in\Tcal$ is represented as an order set of \gps\ locations in time series defined as
\begin{align*}
	T_i = \{(x_{i,1},y_{i,1}),\cdots,(x_{i,m_i},y_{i,m_i})\},
\end{align*}
