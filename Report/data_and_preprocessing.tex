\subsection{Preliminaries}

\edmd\ dataset contains the information of a collection of $68,479$ sport tracks (e.g., walking, running, cycling).
We use $\Tcal=\{T_i\}_{i=1}^n$ to denote the collection of tracks where we have $n=68,479$.
Each track $T_i\in\Tcal$ is represented as a set of geographical points on the map (\gps\ locations) ordered by timestamps defined as
\begin{align*}
	T_i = \{(x_{i,1},y_{i,1},t_{i,1}),\cdots,(x_{i,m_i},y_{i,m_i},t_{i,m_i})\},
\end{align*}
where $x_{i,j}$ is the longitude, $y_{i,j}$ is the latitude, $t_{i,j}$ is the timestamp when $(x_{i,j},y_{i,j})$ is recorded by the tracking devices, $m_i$ is the total number of pointed recored for track $T_i$.
In addition, we have $t_{i,j}<t_{i,k}$ when $j<k$.

Each track $T_i$ is then represented as an undirected graph $G_i = (V_i,E_i)$ defined on a $2$D surface.
The vertex set $V_i=\{(x_{i,j},y_{i,j})\}_{j=1}^{m_i}$ includes all \gps\ locations of track $T_i$.
There exist an undirected edge $e_{i,k}$ between vertex $v_{i,k}$ and $v_{i,k+1}$ $\forall k\le m_i-1$.
As a result, the edge set is defined as a collection of undirected edges $E_i = \{e_{i,k}\}_{k=1}^{m_i-1}$.

\subsection{Global graph representation}

The goal is to analyze all available track information and recommend an ideal track for individual end user.
We cannot maintain all individual track information $T_i, V_i$ separately due to the followings
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is computationally expensive to analyze $68,479$ tracks each time when we perform the recommendation or searching algorithm.
\end{itemize}
