\subsection{\edmd\ dataset}

\edmd\ dataset contains the information of a collection of $68,479$ sport tracks (e.g., walking, running, cycling).
We use $\Tcal=\{T_i\}_{i=1}^n$ to denote the collection of tracks where we have $n=68,479$.
Each track $T_i\in\Tcal$ is represented as a set of geographical points on the map (\gps\ locations) ordered by timestamps defined as
\begin{align*}
	T_i = \{(x_{i,1},y_{i,1},t_{i,1}),\cdots,(x_{i,m_i},y_{i,m_i},t_{i,m_i})\},
\end{align*}
where $x_{i,j}$ is the longitude, $y_{i,j}$ is the latitude, and $t_{i,j}$ is the timestamp when $(x_{i,j},y_{i,j})$ is recorded by the tracking devices.
In addition, we have $t_{i,j}<t_{i,k}$ when $j<k$.
