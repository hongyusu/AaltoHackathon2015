This report describes a personalized track recommendation system built by \team\ in Aalto Data Science Hackathon 2015.
The developed recommendation system is able to analyze all available track information from \edmd and  compute an ideal track which satisfies user profile or various input conditions
The system can also visualize the computed track both as a rout on the map and as a preview movie comprised by a collection of pictures along the track.  
In addition, we are able to extract information from the social network (e.g., \twitter) base on time and \gps\ locations, and annotate the computed tracks with enriched context.
The annotation not only enables user to review the activities along the recommended tracks, it also provides us opportunities to analyze and recommend tracks based on e.g., sentiment information.
