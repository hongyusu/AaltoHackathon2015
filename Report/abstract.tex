This report describes a personalized track recommendation system built by \team\ in Aalto Data Science Hackathon 2015.
The developed recommendation system is able to analyze all available track information from \edmd, compute an ideal track which satisfies user profile or input conditions, and visualize the computed track both as a rout on the map and as a preview movie of a collection of pictures along the track.
