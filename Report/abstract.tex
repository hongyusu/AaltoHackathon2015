This report describes a personalized track recommendation system built by \team\ in Aalto Data Science Hackathon 2015.
The developed recommendation system is able to analyze all available track information from \edmd and  compute an ideal track which satisfies user profile or various input conditions
In addition, the system can visualize the computed track both as a rout on the map and as a preview movie comprised by a collection of pictures along the track.
